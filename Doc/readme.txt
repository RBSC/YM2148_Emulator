Yamaha YM2148 Emulator Board v1.0
Copyright (c) 2017 RBSC

About
-----

This project's goal was to emulate Yamaha's YM2148 chip that has no official datasheet. We had to reverse engineer the chip because
Yamaha refused to provide the PDF with the chip's description. The reverse engineering was done in order to correctly emulate the
chip in our own SFG cartridge project.

IMPORTANT! When assembling the board please make sure that you add 10 kOhm resistors from SD0-SD7 lines to +5V! See the included
pictures for the way to mount the resistors.

Only one chip was harmed during this project...
