Yamaha YM2148 Emulator Board v1.0

About
-----

This project's goal was to emulate Yamaha's YM2148 chip that has no official datasheet. We had to reverse engineer the chip because
Yamaha refused to provide the PDF with the chip's description. The reverse engineering was done in order to correctly emulate the
chip in our own SFG cartridge project.

Only one chip was harmed during this project...
